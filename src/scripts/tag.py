#    Description: The idea is to run this simple script after a few modification to create 
#                 tag and also release in case certain criteria are met.
#
#                 The script looks for `CHANGE_LOGS.md` in the current working directory
#                 it assumes the mentioned file has the following format
#                 ðŸ‘‰ Checkout `CHANGE_LOG.md` of this very repository (link at the top)
#                 
# ## vx.y.z[-beta|rc|stable] <- the `## ` sequence is mandatory
# 
# <any text>
# 
# ======= <-- this is mandatory, it's 7 equal signs
# 
# ## vx.y.z[-beta|rc|stable]
# 
# <any text>
# 
# =======
# 
# ## vx.y.z[-beta|rc|stable]
# 
# <any text>
#
#
#                 The scripts opens the file, get the version from the first line, reads
#                 until it gets the 7 equal signs or EOF.
#                 if the version has no "rc", "beta", "stable" no release will be generated
#                 only a proper tag will be added. but in case it's "stable" a release with
#                 marked as latest will be generated otherwise a release marked as pre-
#                 production will be generated. and in case a release is make any files
#                 mentioned in "release_files" list will be added to the release too.

# name of the folder to zip this path is relative to the current working directory
# it means if you run it from the root folder it looks for the folder to be zipped
# in the root folder
# leave it empty string `''` for disabling zip
folder_to_zip = '<TODO:: CHANGE THE VALUE HERE>'

# you can list name of file or files you would like to be added individually to github
# releases
